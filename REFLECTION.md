So I approached this with a more traditional looping strucutre while still being async. One challenging thing I encountered was how to do mood for some things but not others. Eventually I realised I could use an if statement with just the variable name. I added the creative element of mood using emojis. I think my simulation represents real world time pretty well since I used the real world time in seconds, which is in milleseconds in the simulation. I think as an actual schedule it's not great but it does an interesting time visualizing my day.
